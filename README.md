# E-Commerce Website

Welcome to my **E-Commerce Website**!  
Hello, I'm **Regan**, and I developed this e-commerce website using **SCSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**. The design was initially created on **Figma**, and I implemented it to build a **responsive**, **modern**, and **functional** e-commerce platform.

## Features
- **Fully responsive** design built with **SCSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**
- **Smooth and interactive user experience** with optimized performance
- **Product display**, **categories**, and **cart functionalities** (to be added later)
- **Modern UI** based on a design from **Figma**

## Technologies Used
- **SCSS**: For modular and maintainable styling.
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content handling.
