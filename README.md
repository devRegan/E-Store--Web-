# E-Commerce Website

Hello, I'm **Regan**, and I created this E-Commerce website using **SCSS**, **HTML**, and **JavaScript**. The design was initially made on **Figma**, and I implemented it to build a responsive and functional e-commerce platform.

## Features
- Fully responsive design built with SCSS, HTML, and JavaScript
- Smooth and interactive user experience
- Product display, categories, and cart functionalities (to be added later)
- Modern UI based on a design from Figma

## Technologies Used
- **SCSS** for styling and creating a modular CSS structure
- **HTML** for the basic structure and layout
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and dynamic content
- **Figma** (Design reference)
